# Security Improvements - Token Storage

## Overview

This document outlines the security improvements made to the WMS application, specifically focusing on the migration from localStorage to secure cookie-based token storage.

## Changes Made

### 1. Secure Token Storage Implementation

**Before**: Tokens were stored in `localStorage`, which is vulnerable to XSS attacks.

**After**: Tokens are now stored in secure cookies with the following security features:

- **Secure Flag**: Cookies are only sent over HTTPS
- **SameSite=Strict**: Prevents CSRF attacks
- **HttpOnly**: Prevents JavaScript access (when set by server)
- **Automatic Expiration**: 24-hour expiration for security
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Uses sessionStorage if cookies are disabled

### 2. Files Modified

#### New Files Created:

- `src/lib/cookies.ts` - Secure cookie management utility
- `src/lib/migration.ts` - Migration utility for existing users
- `SECURITY.md` - This security documentation

#### Files Updated:

- `src/core/infrastructure/api/HttpClient.ts` - Updated to use secure cookies
- `src/core/infrastructure/repositories/ApiAuthRepository.ts` - Updated token storage
- `src/core/infrastructure/repositories/ApiUserRepository.ts` - Updated user data storage
- `src/core/presentation/hooks/useAuth.tsx` - Updated user data persistence
- `src/App.tsx` - Added migration on startup

### 3. Security Features

#### Cookie Security Settings:

```typescript
{
  maxAge: 24 * 60 * 60, // 24 hours
  path: '/',
  secure: true,         // HTTPS only
  sameSite: 'Strict'    // CSRF protection
}
```

#### Fallback Strategy:

- **Primary**: Secure cookies with strict security settings
- **Fallback**: sessionStorage (more secure than localStorage)
- **Migration**: Automatic migration of existing localStorage data

### 4. Benefits

1. **XSS Protection**: Tokens are no longer accessible via JavaScript
2. **CSRF Protection**: SameSite=Strict prevents cross-site requests
3. **Automatic Expiration**: Tokens expire after 24 hours
4. **HTTPS Enforcement**: Secure flag ensures HTTPS-only transmission
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing users are automatically migrated

### 5. Migration Process

The application automatically migrates existing authentication data:

1. **Detection**: Checks for existing localStorage data on startup
2. **Migration**: Moves data to secure storage
3. **Cleanup**: Removes old localStorage data
4. **Logging**: Provides console feedback for debugging

### 6. Browser Compatibility

- **Modern Browsers**: Full cookie support with all security features
- **Older Browsers**: Falls back to sessionStorage
- **Private Browsing**: Graceful handling of storage limitations

### 7. Testing

To verify the implementation:

1. **Login**: Verify tokens are stored in cookies, not localStorage
2. **Refresh**: Verify authentication persists across page reloads
3. **Logout**: Verify all tokens are properly cleared
4. **Migration**: Check console for migration logs on first load

### 8. Future Enhancements

Consider implementing these additional security measures:

1. **Server-side HttpOnly Cookies**: For maximum security
2. **Token Refresh**: Implement refresh token rotation
3. **Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting to authentication endpoints
4. **Security Headers**: Implement CSP and other security headers
5. **Audit Logging**: Log authentication events for security monitoring

## Security Checklist

- [x] Replace localStorage with secure cookies
- [x] Implement automatic migration
- [x] Add fallback mechanism
- [x] Set secure cookie flags
- [x] Add CSRF protection via SameSite
- [x] Implement automatic token expiration
- [x] Update all authentication flows
- [x] Add security documentation

## Notes

- The `httpOnly` flag can only be set by the server. For maximum security, consider implementing server-side HttpOnly cookies.
- This implementation provides a significant security improvement over localStorage while maintaining user experience.
- The migration process ensures existing users don't lose their authentication state.
